We have included a file listing the md5sums of the data files in here.
If you have the 'md5sum' utility installed (most Linux machines at least),
You can verify file integrity by running 'md5sum -c md5sums.txt'.

Note that this download was from an assoicated calibrations page -
it only contains the calibration files that are associated with the science query.
